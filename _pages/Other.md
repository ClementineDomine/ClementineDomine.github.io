You will find here some media content and my crossover of art and science.
This blog aims to show the strong links between art and the sciences. 
Often these two disciplines are described and thought of as incompatible. 
This separation between art and science is easily observed on university campuses
where their respective faculties are located opposite the campus. 
Far from being conflicting subjects, they complete, help, grow, inspire and understand each other. 
There exist infinite amounts of ways to show the close relationship between art and science. 
Here are a few I like and wanted to share. I hope you like it. Enjoy the art, learn the science.
I started this project on Instagram (@artlovesciences) a 4 years ago.
