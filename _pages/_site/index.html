<p>I am a PhD candidate at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, supervised by Andrew Saxe and Caswell Barry. My work sits at the intersection of theoretical neuroscience and theoretical machine learning. Previously, I completed a degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Manchester, with an exchange at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>At a high level, my research aims to understand how the brain learns and forms representations to perform complex tasks, such as continual, curriculum, and reversal learning, as well as the acquisition of structured knowledge. I develop mathematical frameworks grounded in deep learning theory to describe complex and adaptive learning mechanisms, addressing questions from both machine learning and cognitive science/neuroscience perspectives.</p>

<p>Beyond my research, I am deeply involved in the academic community. I co-organize the  <a href="https://unireps.org">UniReps : Unifying Representations in Neural Models workshop </a> at NeurIPS , an event dedicated to fostering collaboration and dialogue between researchers working to unify our understanding of representations in biological and artificial neural networks. ðŸ”µðŸ”´</p>
