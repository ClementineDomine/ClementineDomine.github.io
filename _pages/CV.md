<h3> <span style="color:#DAA520">Research Experience </span></h3>


#### ELLISE PhD Mobility Program, Sapienza Università di Roma, Rome, Italy
<em>ElliSE Research Rotation 2021 - 2022</em><br>

Supervised by Petar Veličković (DeepMind) and Emmanuele Rodolà (Sapienza), I studied the binding properties of antibody-antigen using tools of geometric deep learning. Predicting of the antibody-antigen binding region is key to developing vaccines and synthetic antibodies.

#### Blue Brain Project École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland
<em>Summer Intern 2018 - 2019</em><br>

Summer internship at the EPFL Blue Brain Project with Dr. Rajnish Ranjan, Section Manager of the Membrane Systems Group in the Simulation Neuroscience Division (Lausanne, Switzerland). My primary duties included in redesigning and upgrading the existing ion channel model fitting with Hodgkin-Huxley and Markov model formulation (Writting).

#### The University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, USA
<em>Undergraduate research 2018 - 2019</em><br>

Supervised research at UCLA with Pr. R. Bruinsma. Study of a method of quantum state manipulation, inspired by the spin echo, which can reduce the time uncertainty error for quantum computer applications. (Papers publishes following this initial work: 1 & 2) Supervised research at UCLA with Pr. K. Arisaka. Study of the depth visual information encoding by the theta phase using reaction time in Virtual reality. (Poster)

#### CERN, Geneva, Switzerland/ The University of Manchester (UoM), Manchester, United Kingdom
<em>Scientific Collaborator 2017 - 2018</em><br>

Study of the E-kick procedure optimization using MATLAB PIC code simulation for non- neutral plasma with the ALPHA experiment at CERN continued as a master’s project with Dr Will Bertsche.

#### CERN, Geneva, Switzerland
<em>Summer Intern  2016 - 2017 2017 - 2018</em><br>

The ALPHA experiment is working with trapped anti-hydrogen atoms and aims at studying fundamental symmetries between matter and anti-matter. I developed my computing and electronic skills by working on a project around a “push-pull” Mosfet circuit for the security valve of the apparatus. I developed computing and electronic skills by working on the electronic circuit of the security valve for the cryostat for the future Alpha-G experiment measuring the gravity constant with anti-matter. Day-to-day running of the experiment. (Record of the most anti-hydrogen caught) Assisted Summer Student lectures. Certified guide inside the AD facility.
