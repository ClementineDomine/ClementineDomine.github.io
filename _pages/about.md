### About me
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at ISTA, supported by the Cluster of Excellence (CoE) Fellowship, where I work with Marco Mondelli and Francesco Locatello.

### Research
My research lies at the intersection of theoretical neuroscience and theoretical machine learning. Broadly, I aim to understand how the brain learns and builds representations to carry out complex behaviors—such as continual, curriculum, and reversal learning, as well as the acquisition of structured knowledge. I develop mathematical frameworks rooted in deep learning theory to describe adaptive and complex learning mechanisms, addressing questions that bridge machine learning and cognitive neuroscience.

### Trainning
I completed my PhD at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit under the supervision of Andrew Saxe and Caswell Barry. Before that, I earned a degree in Theoretical Physics from the University of Manchester, including an exchange at the University of California, Los Angeles.

### Community
Beyond my research, I am deeply involved in the academic community. I co-organize the  <a href= "https://unireps.org">UniReps : Unifying Representations in Neural Models workshop </a> at NeurIPS , an event dedicated to fostering collaboration and dialogue between researchers working to unify our understanding of representations in biological and artificial neural networks. 🔵🔴

### Mentoring and collaboration
Interested in working together on questions at the intersection of biological and artificial intelligence? I especially welcome students from underrepresented groups in cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI. Mentorship and collaboration are central to my work—feel free to reach out!
