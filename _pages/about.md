I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, supervised by [Andrew Saxe](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/saxe-lab) and [Caswell Barry](https://barry-lab.com), working at the intersection of theoretical neuroscience and theoretical machine learning. My research seeks to develop mathematical toolkits suitable for describing complex and flexible learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological agents.


I focus on continual learning, reversal learning, and the acquisition of structured knowledge. Specifically, I study the theory of deep learning, which involves artificial neural networks inspired by the brain. By integrating deep learning theory, engineering, and insights from biological intelligence, I aim to enhance the ability of deep learning systems to continuously learn, adapt, and revise their knowledge in response to new users and contexts.
