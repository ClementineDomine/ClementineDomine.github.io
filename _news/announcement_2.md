ðŸš€ We're excited to launch the [ELLIS UniReps speaker-series](https://unireps.org/speaker-series/), a monthly event exploring how neural modelsâ€”both biological and artificialâ€”develop similar internal representations, and what this means for learning, alignment, and reuse. Each session features a keynote by a senior researcher and a flash talk by an early-career scientist, fostering cross-disciplinary dialogue at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and cognitive science! ðŸ”µðŸ”´
